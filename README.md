# C# Fundamentals Overview

## Introduction

Below are some of the topics which we used to teach as part of the introductory part of the C# course. The Workshops (I'll add these asap) are the parts which correspond to the morning teaching session introducing the topic, the Exercises are the tasks which we would do as the Afternoon Exercise and would usually be graded.

Based on feedback we have removed these parts from the course as many of you have already learnt to program in one or more language. We're providing them here as a resource, if there are topics you are not already familiar with, or that you have not done in C# before then attempt the corresponding exercise to help familiarise yourself with the content.

None of these are mandatory but if you haven't done C# before (or recently) then working through them will definitely help.

## Process

1. Fork the repo into your own GitHub Account.
2. Clone the forked repo from your account.
3. Open the repo in IntelliJ and work through the exercise.
4. Run any tests to make sure your code works properly.
5. Push the solution back to your copy of the GitHub repo.
6. Once you have fully completed the exercise, open a new Pull Request in your GitHub copy of the repo back to the Boolean repo, but rename the PR to use your first and last names (this makes it easier for us to track who is submitting their work).

Although these activities are not formally marked it will allow you to make sure you understand the process we use with the marked activities.
